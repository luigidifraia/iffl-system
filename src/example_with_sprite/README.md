# IFFL System Example with Sprite
The example in this folder implements a familiar scenario: load data for a few sprite images, a tune, a multicolor bitmap picture, and display a single sprite while the loading and tune playback is in progress.

## Notes
- The one-bit protocol is used in this example, in order to allow a sprite on screen.
