## CMD FD2000 disk images
In order to use the provided disk image for CMD FD2000 floppy drives, `fd2000_new_native_partition.d2m`, with the [Versatile Commodore Emulator](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net), VICE, you need to acquire an FD2000 ROM first.\
You can then copy files from either a .d64 or .d81 image to a .d2m one by using a file copier, e.g. IDE64's File Manager, which is part of [IDEDOS](http://idedos.ide64.org).\
Setup instructions for IDEDOS in VICE are available [here](http://www.ide64.org/vice_ide64_howto_rev2.txt).\
The IDE64 File Manager can be started with the F8 key once you are in direct mode. For additional commands, including file copy and delete, have a look at the IDE64 user's guide [here](http://www.ide64.org/down.html).
